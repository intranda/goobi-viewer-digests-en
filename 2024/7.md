## Developments

### Sidebar widgets

The conditions under which widgets or content from widgets are displayed in the sidebar have grown and adapted over the years. With the July release, we have fundamentally tidied this up and introduced a standardised, new system that can be used to control what is displayed when and how. There will probably be some reworking in the coming months because we let a few things slip through during the migration, but the new DisplayConditions will help us to keep an overview in the future. Further information, especially for developers, can be found in the Javadocs:

### Snippets

* EPub documents can now be displayed inline in the Goobi viewer desktop client
* An annoying bug that downloaded JPEG files as JFIF when downloading under Windows has been fixed by implementing a workaround
