## Developments&#x20;

### Maps

The functionality of the cards presented in April is extended with this release. From now on, the design of the markers for a card can be selected. This makes it easier to visually separate different types of cards. The markers are configurable and some examples are already predefined in the standard configuration file. See also [chapter 2.36](https://docs.goobi.io/goobi-viewer-en/2/2.36) in the documentation.

![The marker to be used can be defined individually per map](../.gitbook/assets/2020-05\_maps\_overview.png)

For maps that are automatically generated based on a Solr query, it is now possible to select what should be displayed in the marker popup. Available for selection:

* Do not display a popup&#x20;
* The name of the displayed location
* The value of the metadata

This differentiation is important, for example, if a map with facilities is to be shown where the name of the facility is shown, but on another map the name of the place where the facility is located.

When maps are displayed in the sidebar, an icon is now available in the title of the widget to view the map in large size. It will be opened in an overlay. This allows a better navigation with many values.

The maps configured in the backend are available via an oEmbed endpoint. This allows the maps to be embedded directly into a Wordpress instance, for example. The link to the oEmbed URL is displayed in the backend in the map overview.&#x20;

Wordpress has a built-in whitelist on pages where oEmbed is familiar with rich content. To add a Goobi viewer instance, simply enter the desired Goobi viewer instance as oEmbed provider in the theme editor of the theme where` functions.php` is located. You can use this code snippet to do this, for example:

```php
// Register custom oEmbed provider
function goobiviewer_oembed_provider() {
	wp_oembed_add_provider( 'https://viewer.goobi.io/*', 'https://viewer.goobi.io/oembed' );
}
add_action( 'init', 'goobiviewer_oembed_provider' );
```

### Search

In the context search there have been several minor adjustments.&#x20;

For example, the number of hits on the page with the search hits is now selectable in a drop-down menu. Previously the value was set statically in the configuration file. Now a list can be stored there from which the user can choose. The default values are `10`, `25`, `50` and `100` hits.&#x20;

There are also two small changes in the sorting. Firstly, the default sorting by "Relevance" is now named like this and can be reset to it after a change. Secondly, it is now ensured that the field after sorting is always visible in the displayed metadata for the work. It is displayed even if it has not been configured for this in the `<searchHitMetadataList />`. With this change the sorting can be understood and compared much faster.&#x20;

More under the hood but important for maintainability is the homogenization of the search field itself. There were four different implementations for this. These were merged and adjusted by the styling. This component is now used everywhere.

### Feedback&#x20;

The security mechanism presented last month with the honeypot fields and the security question against SPAM bots when registering new user accounts was also integrated into the feedback form. The reCaptcha functionality has been removed at this point. At the same time the pool of standard questions was extended.

![The feedback form now also includes security questions.](../.gitbook/assets/2020-05\_feedback\_security\_question.png)

### ContentServer&#x20;

The intranda ContentServer now passes images in GIF format directly through. This means that it is now possible to upload small animations in the back end and use them in CMS.&#x20;

### Goobi viewer indexer&#x20;

The Goobi viewer Indexer supports the interpolation of annual figures. See also [section 3.7.20](https://docs.goobi.io/goobi-viewer-en/3/3.7#3-7-20-parameter-interpolateyears) in the documentation.&#x20;

The dependency on Joda-Time has also been removed and replaced by the native java.time implementation.
