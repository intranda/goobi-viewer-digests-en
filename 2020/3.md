# March

## Coming soon&#x20;

* :closed\_lock\_with\_key: **Shibboleth**&#x20;
* :map: **Maps**
* :tools: **improved usabillity in the Admin Backend**

## General&#x20;

Despite the many circumstances and changes, the Goobi viewer has again seen a great deal of activity in March. More on this below.&#x20;

The developments on the bookmark list and the individual IIIF Collections from January were mentioned in the IIIF Newsletter:

{% hint style="warning" %}
In the next version, the upload of DOC, DOCX and HTML files in the backend will be removed. Uploading PDF files will provide a better and more reliable alternative.
{% endhint %}

## Developments

### Create Dublin Core records via the backend

Until now, the Goobi viewer has accepted data records in METS/MODS, LIDO and DENKXWEB format from external systems in order to index and display them. However, creating these formats is an additional hurdle for smaller institutions. To reduce this hurdle, a new form has been added to the Goobi viewer backend that can be used to create Dublin Core data records with associated images. The new "New record" page has been added to the "Administration" section:

![New Dublin Core records can be created in the backend](../.gitbook/assets/2020-03\_dublincore\_backend\_metadata.png)

![Uploaded images are sorted by file name and can be deleted individually.](../.gitbook/assets/2020-03\_dublincore\_backend\_media\_finished.png)

The only mandatory metadata is the title. A UUID is automatically generated in the background as an identifier. A drop-down menu with values is available for language and rights information. For example, valid ISO 639-2b language codes can be written without having to know them. An inline help is available for all fields, which optionally displays further notes and descriptions. After saving, the data is automatically indexed and is directly visible. All known functions such as image display, bibliographic data display or search are available.&#x20;

Of course, unlimited access to the IIIF functions is also possible. IIIF Presentation Manifests are generated automatically and the images are delivered via the IIIF Image API. With the integrated campaigns the manifests can be enriched with annotations and with the watchlist functionality the data sets can be combined to individual IIIF Collections.&#x20;

The following screencast shows all these functions in full:

### Conditions for the display of metadata&#x20;

The Goobi viewer now supports conditions when displaying metadata. The use case that was implemented during development is as follows:&#x20;

An institution digitises various records that are still under copyright in order to preserve the collection. When indexing content, it is specified that these records are subject to a moving wall as access restrictions and may only be displayed from a defined year onwards. At the time of automatic activation, the works have the "Public Domain Mark" license. This is also already included in the metadata.&#x20;

However, the Goobi viewer has now been configured so that the records subject to the moving wall can be displayed on a dedicated reading station PC within the facility. However, no incorrect rights details should be entered there. For this reason, the rights for the licences were already extended in February so that access to the IIIF manifests and the downloading of metadata can be restricted. This picture is now completed with the conditions for displaying metadata. It is now possible to change the display of the metadata with the license for the period of the Moving Wall on the reading station PC to a different value than the one entered during content indexing.&#x20;

More about this including an example in[ chapter 2.19.1](https://docs.goobi.io/goobi-viewer-en/2/2.19/2.19.1) in the documentation.

### Separators in the advanced search&#x20;

For better structuring of the values in the drop down menu within the advanced search it is now possible to configure separators.&#x20;

More information including an example in [chapter 2.17.3](https://docs.goobi.io/goobi-viewer-en/2/2.17/2.17.3) in the documentation.

### LIDO metadata and events in the sidebar&#x20;

Previously, metadata and events from LIDO records were displayed in different tabs below the image. In addition, there was a "Bibliographic Data" widget in the sidebar that could only display the metadata of the main data set.&#x20;

For LIDO records the widget "Bibliographic Data" is no longer available and the display of LIDO metadata and events is moved to the sidebar. This homogenizes the display of metadata across all supported formats and brings it more into focus. Instead of tabs, a separate box is now displayed for each event.

![Metadata from LIDO records are now displayed in the sidebar.](../.gitbook/assets/2020-03\_lido\_metadata\_in\_sidebar.png)

### CMS template for browsing&#x20;

There is a new CMS template for the "browse" functionality. On the page itself you can select the desired Solr field in a drop down menu. This field must be defined in the local configuration file as described in [chapter 2.19.8](https://docs.goobi.io/goobi-viewer-en/2/2.19/2.19.8).&#x20;

If the CMS page is assigned to a subtheme, the output values only refer to the subtheme. This means that partners who share a common Goobi viewer instance can use the sub-themes to maintain their own sub-areas and offer browsing only for their own content.

### **Other**&#x20;

* The integrated **TinyMCE editor** has been updated to **version 5**.&#x20;
* The **Share image region** function is now also available in the **full screen** display&#x20;
* An individual **Mapbox** **token** can be defined for the use of the widget for displaying geo coordinates
* **Developers** can now control whether CMS media should also be loaded via the external IIIF interface or from localhost&#x20;

### Goobi viewer Indexer

#### Indexing of Dublin Core records&#x20;

The Goobi viewer Indexer has been extended to include the option of indexing Dublin Core data records created in the back end. A record created in this way looks like this, for example:

```markup
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>

<record xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">
    <dc:title>Garden images</dc:title>
    <dc:description>I created these images in my garden in spring 2020.</dc:description>
    <dc:language>ger</dc:language>
    <dc:creator>Jan Vonde</dc:creator>
    <dc:identifier>4fda256e-70b3-11ea-b891-08606e6a464a</dc:identifier>
    <dc:subject>dcdublincore</dc:subject>
    <dc:date>2020</dc:date>
    <dc:rights>http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/</dc:rights>
    <dc:relation>IMG_20200322_144253.jpg</dc:relation>
    <dc:relation>IMG_20200322_144324.jpg</dc:relation>
    <dc:relation>IMG_20200322_144401.jpg</dc:relation>
</record>
```

Please also refer to the [update instructions](https://docs.goobi.io/goobi-viewer-de/8/8.1#4-5-0).&#x20;

#### Upward inheritance of metadata&#x20;

With the new button `<addToParents>true</addToParents>` metadata can be moved into the main element.&#x20;

Background: In a project, a central overview of all persons who have worked on a project should be displayed per activity. These persons are distributed to the different structural elements with their dedicated roles. With the new button the persons can be written in a separate index field in the main document and displayed constantly in the sidebar with the `topstructValueFallback="true"` attribute in the core.&#x20;

See also [chapter 2.19.4 ](https://docs.goobi.io/goobi-viewer-en/2/2.19/2.19.4)and [chapter 3.7.18](https://docs.goobi.io/goobi-viewer-en/3/3.7#3-7-18-parameter-addtoparents) in the documentation.&#x20;

#### Boolean whether record contains images or not

As of version 4.5.0, the Goobi viewer indexer automatically writes the `BOOL_IMAGEAVAILABLE` field, which contains a Boolean indicating whether or not a record has images.&#x20;

### Goobi viewer connector&#x20;

The OBJID in the METS header files is now also output via OAI
