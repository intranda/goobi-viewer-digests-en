# January

## Coming soon&#x20;

* :map: **Maps**

## General

The new year is off to a cracking start. There are some great new features in the Goobi viewer and a lot has happened in the background!&#x20;

At the turn of the year, the Goobi viewer has passed the 1000 automatic unit tests mark. These tests automatically check whether functionality and logic behave as intended. This ensures that once an error has been corrected, it won't reappear or, if existing functionality is changed, that it won't break down.&#x20;

In addition, the Goobi viewer core has been switched to the standard Maven folder structure in the background. This completes the change of the build system, which began a year ago. It is also already bearing its first fruits: many of the Java libraries used have been updated and brought up to the latest version.&#x20;

The automatic generation of releases is also new. In the Goobi viewer core, indexer and connector, files compiled and required for installation can be downloaded directly from Github.&#x20;

We have recently updated the database on the [Goobi viewer demo and test instance](https://viewer.goobi.io/).

**Attention**: This is the last Goobi viewer release that contains the source code for the overview pages. The functionality was migrated to the CMS one year ago. We will remove the deprecated source code in the next release.

## Developments&#x20;

### Reading lists&#x20;

The reading lists have been extensively revised. Various feedback from the community has been incorporated. The new features are in detail:&#x20;

#### Save images&#x20;

From now on it is also possible to save individual images within a reading list. Until now this was only possible for records. With this extension, content can now be compiled in a much more granular way. The choice whether to save the record or the current image is in the familiar dialog.

The desire for this functionality has been expressed frequently in the community. Most recently in the context of crowdsourcing and campaigns where the need was expressed to be able to curate campaigns not only for whole record but also for dedicated content. With the possibility to save single images on reading lists a first step in this direction has been taken.&#x20;

#### Open comparison view with only one record

Also from the community came the wish to be able to [open the comparison view with only one record](https://community.goobi.io/t/goobi-viewer-digest-fuer-dezember-2019/446/2). Since the content was well suited to this wish, it could also be considered directly.&#x20;

#### Share reading lists&#x20;

It is now possible to share reading lists with other users. Three variants are available for this.&#x20;

**Sharing with a user group**: If a user is a member of a user group, he/she can share reading lists with the other members of this group.&#x20;

**Sharing via a cryptic link**: A cryptic link can be generated for each reading list. This can then be passed on and external users can view the reading list and its contents without authentication. Sharing via a cryptic link can also be revoked or the link can be generated again.&#x20;

**Public for all:** A reading list can also be published completely. It is then visible for every user without registration. There is a new page that lists the public reading lists of an instance. The page can be added to the menu as usual. The page can be provided with individual text via a dedicated CMS template.

#### Reading lists and IIIF&#x20;

The IIIF idea has been consistently developed further here as well. The contents of a reading list shared by link or public reading list are available as IIIF collection. In this way, every user can compile his own individual IIIF collections from the data stock.&#x20;

### Reading list overview

The overview of the existing reading lists now directly shows the thumbnails of the contents. This allows a faster overview and access to the contents.&#x20;

#### Backend&#x20;

There were also very large changes in the background. In the past, the reading lists were called bookshelves. When they were renamed to bookmarks some time ago, 50% of the code was still called `bookshelf`, 30% `readinglist` and 20% `watchlist`. The name was internally uniformly adjusted to the name `bookmark`.&#x20;

### Citation links for image sections

New is the possibility to create citation links for image sections. This strengthens the possibility for collaborative work with the dataset. Users can mark image areas, e.g. links to these areas can be passed on by email. Above the image, the "Share image region" functionality can be activated. Then a box can be opened within the displayed image. Next to the rectangle, the user is then offered to copy the link to the page with the box itself, or the link to the selected image fragment via IIIF Image API.&#x20;

If the link is passed on to the page, the box will be displayed directly in the image when the page is loaded. In addition, the two links to the page and to the image fragment are available in the "Cite and re-use" widget.

![The "Share image region" function is located above the displayed image](../.gitbook/assets/2020-01\_shareregion.png)

![After drawing a rectangle on the image, two options are offered](../.gitbook/assets/2020-01\_shareregion1.png)

The example shown here can be viewed under the following link:&#x20;

### Series and records with anchor

If a record is part of a multi-volume work or part of a series / convolute, a link is immediately displayed in the sidebar that refers to this content. Until now, this had to be explicitly enabled for individual instances. The links refer to the series / convolute or the complete work. If a work is part of several series, the series - if configured - are listed by name.

![Links to convolute / series and entire work are visible in the sidebar.](../.gitbook/assets/2020-01\_partofandanchor.png)

### Full screen display

In the full screen display there were several minor adjustments. For example, the "search within this record" functionality is now also available.&#x20;

Furthermore, it is possible to configure the page that is called up when leaving the full screen mode. More about this in [chapter 2.12](https://docs.intranda.com/goobi-viewer-en/2/2.12) of the documentation.&#x20;

### Authentication

OCLC's Bibliotheca is another authentication provider that can be configured for user login. See [chapter 2.5.1](https://docs.intranda.com/goobi-viewer-de/2/2.5/2.5.1) of the documentation for more information.&#x20;

### Portuguese language support&#x20;

The Portuguese language support has been updated from within the community. Many thanks for this! :-)&#x20;

### DenkXweb

The Goobi viewer Indexer can now also index records in the DenkXweb standard that contain images. Minor adjustments have been made to the Goobi viewer core in order to better display the data records in the standard.&#x20;

### Advanced search&#x20;

The advanced search has got a support for multilingual metadata - recognizable by the `_LANG_` fields. If these fields are configured for the advanced search, only the fields of the language active in the browser will be displayed - as with other areas.
