# August

August brings some minor improvements to the Goobi viewer.&#x20;

This month's highlight is a small change to the login screen, the first fully merged pull request from the community! Previous change requests that were submitted as code contributions had been taken over manually.&#x20;

The publication of an installation guide for the Goobi viewer should also be mentioned here. In addition to the possibility of testing the Goobi viewer within Goobi-to-go by double-clicking, a complete installation guide is now available for the first time.

## Developments

### Search

Now you can search in all volumes that belong together as well as in the already known search options. The widget "Search in records" is also displayed in the table of contents of anchor records such as multi-volume works, journals or newspapers.&#x20;

Similarly, you can search in all works in a convolute or series.&#x20;

A completely new feature is the possibility to search in the records of a reading list. A link is available for non-registered users in the drop-down menu of the reading list. Authenticated users can start a search from the overview of the saved reading lists. Both variants lead to the extended search mask in which the session reading list or alternatively one of the saved reading lists can be selected for the search.

### Widget: "Cite and reuse "

In the widget "Cite and re-use" there are several new possibilities:&#x20;

1. On page level the displayed image can be downloaded as JPEG. A new button in the configuration file can be used to set the size of the image or to deactivate the button completely.&#x20;
2. At page level, the master image can also be offered for download in the Goobi viewer. A new badge "Master (FILEENDUNG)" is available for this purpose. The file extension is adapted to TIF, JP2 or PNG, for example, depending on the image format. This function can also be deactivated using a new switch. See also [chapter 2.23](https://docs.intranda.com/goobi-viewer-en/2/2.23) in the documentation for points 1 and 2.&#x20;
3. There is a new "Structural element" area between the "Work" and "Page" sections. Among other things, the current structural element can be downloaded here as a PDF file.

### Support of RIS

The Goobi viewer generates RIS (Research Information System) files for records and structural elements on request. This adds another widely used and standardized format of literature management software to the Goobi viewer.&#x20;

RIS files for the record or for the active structural element are available in the widget "Cite and reuse". The metadata fields used to generate the file are listed in the list of special Solr fields in [chapter 3.14](https://docs.intranda.com/goobi-viewer-en/3/3.14) of the documentation.

### Metadata display&#x20;

Two new configuration switches provide additional options for displaying metadata.&#x20;

In the  `<mainMetadataList />` a template with the metadata to be displayed can be defined for each publication type. This list of metadata and its sequence is then also used for all structural elements.&#x20;

For technical reasons, metadata such as access restrictions or collections must also be inherited to every structural element. This means, for example, that the collections of the main record are displayed for each structural element, too.&#x20;

From now on, this behavior can be suppressed with the new switch `topstructOnly="true"` for a `<param />` entry. If this is defined for a meta date, then this is only displayed for the main element. See also [chapter 2.19.1](https://docs.intranda.com/goobi-viewer-en/2/2.19/2.19.1) in the documentation.&#x20;

Another button refers to the metadata in the sidebar next to the image. The metadata of the current structure element is displayed here. Thus a title, author etc. is always visible for a journal article. Previously, it was not possible to display metadata from the main element at this point. With the new switch `topstructValueFallback="true"` this is now different. This means, for example, that the signature can always be displayed in the sidebar of a manuscript - independent of the selected structural element.

### Authentication

In the login screen of the possible authentication providers, the configured name was always displayed in the drop-down menu of the possible authentication providers. It is now possible to specify an optional label in the configuration file that is visible in its place. See also [chapter 2.5.1](https://docs.intranda.com/goobi-viewer-en/2/2.5/2.5.1) in the documentation.&#x20;

Thanks at this point to Daniela DÃ¶rr from the Arbeiterkammer Vienna for this functionality (Commit [1](https://github.com/intranda/goobi-viewer-core/commit/5c3221a896552334d424d23f10d649f24b21fb6f) + [2](https://github.com/intranda/goobi-viewer-core/commit/82441da1bb54ae0709a29156a20c2972d48aac98)).

### Installation guide&#x20;

Installation instructions for the Goobi viewer have been included in the documentation. It can be found in [chapter 8.7](https://docs.intranda.com/goobi-viewer-de/8/8.7). The instructions are currently only available in German.

### OAI Interface

If a METS file with an embedded MARCXML dataset is available, the OAI interface does not generate an answer from the MODS when a request for MARCXML is made, but the existing dataset is delivered directly. \
This means that the entire process chain is now possible, from creating a process in Goobi workflow on the basis of MARCXML to exporting it in the METS file and delivering it via OAI.&#x20;

If there is a pure METS/MODS file, the MARCXML record is generated as usual.

### Goobi viewer indexer&#x20;

The Goobi viewer now normalizes the spelling of Unicode characters. Technically, there are several ways to encode letters or special characters. [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalisierung\_\(Unicode\)) lists the following example:

![The "enje" can be encoded as one or two characters. ](../.gitbook/assets/Composicion\_nh.svg.png)

When browsing in the Goobi viewer, it sometimes happened that an author was listed twice with a different number of hits. For the end user, however, the spelling was the same and the same person was meant.&#x20;

The reason for this was the different encoding of the letter names in the name. Once these were combined (NFC), and once disassembled (NFD) stored. This can happen, for example, if you copy and paste metadata when entering it in the catalog or in the Goobi workflow metadata editor.&#x20;

From now on, the Gooobi viewer Indexer automatically normalizes this data to the combined NFC coding. If phenomena such as those described above are visible in your own Goobi viewer instance, the Goobi viewer Indexer should be updated and the database re-indexed.&#x20;

A bug has also been fixed that prevented the service from shutting down cleanly and reliably.
