# October

## Coming soon

* :mag\_right: Support for the **IIIF Content Search API**&#x20;
* :bookmark: Public **reading lists**
* :pencil: A revised **guide to setting up the development environment**

## General

At the user meeting it was hoped that the digests would also be given an outlook. For this reason, we have included the **Coming Soon** section at the very beginning. Here we will report about functionalities that will come but without a concrete time horizon.&#x20;

Also new in this digest is the section of **version numbers** at the end. If you want to adapt your theme to the current version yourself with the help of the [changelog](https://docs.intranda.com/goobi-viewer-de/8/8.2), the version numbers are written down there, which have to be entered in the `pom.xml` to get this function state.&#x20;

After the Goobi User Meeting we would like to present you a video of the App **Cuby**. The app is being developed as a student assistant project for the collection portal of the Central Custody of the University of Göttingen. She talks about the existing REST and IIIF interfaces with the Goobi viewer.&#x20;

We are very happy to see how the Goobi viewer and the content can be used more and more:
