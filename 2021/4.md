# April

* Enhancements to the **maps**
* **Crowdsourcing** adjustments
* URL adjustments for **double pages**

## Developments

### IIIF

The Goobi viewer Core now implements the IIIF Presentation API and the IIIF Image API in the respective 3.0 versions. For this purpose, the new namespace /api/v2/ was introduced in the REST API. This means that the URLs to the previous manifests remain stable. In the configuration file you can set which IIIF version the Goobi viewer delivers by default in its own interface.

For this and other configuration options see also chapter 1.33.2 in the Goobi viewer documentation.&#x20;

### Translations&#x20;

In the past, translations in Goobi viewer were very complicated and complex. The main reason for this was that the content displayed in the interface had to be translated at various points. This was made more difficult by the fact that the content often came from different sources. For the translation there were:&#x20;

* The global messages with the values that the Goobi viewer core itself provides and overwrites with every update.&#x20;
* The local messages with locally overwritten and adapted values.&#x20;
* The CMS backend with individual texts&#x20;

In addition to the three areas already mentioned, the Solr search index also served as a potential source for the display, where both the field names themselves and parts of the field contents are relevant. For example, the field name `MD_LANGUAGE` should not appear in the interface, but `Language`. In addition, the field value `ger` should not appear in the language, but the corresponding translation `German`.&#x20;

Considering that the global messages file contains about 3,400 entries, it quickly became clear that this was far too complicated for users to edit themselves.

For this reason, a new area "Translations" was implemented in the backend. This area can be controlled via the configuration file to release relevant or desired translation groups. Afterwards, an editor is available in the backend, which allows to maintain the translations for the desired languages.&#x20;

All work is consistently saved in the local messages files, there is no database in between or anything similar. A locking mechanism prevents several administrators from working on the files at the same time.&#x20;

The default configuration comes with a pre-selection of five groups that have often been requested for translation in the past:&#x20;

1. The names of the Solr fields (Displayed name of a metadatum).&#x20;
2. The values of the Solr field DC (Collection name)&#x20;
3. The values of the Solr field DOCSTRCT\_TOP (publication types)&#x20;
4. The values of the Solr field DOCSTRCT\_SUB (structure types)&#x20;
5. The e-mail texts of the sent e-mails&#x20;

For more information, see also chapter 1.37 in the Goobi viewer Core documentation and/or here are a few impressions from the interface:

### Access restrictions&#x20;

New is the possibility to restrict the zoom and download of images via an access licence. This means that the normal image display is accessible but the delivered content is restricted. For this purpose, the new functions "image zoom" and "image download" are available for access licences and rights.&#x20;

In the course of this, another configuration switch has been introduced that defines the maximum image width in pixels up to which the image is to be made accessible. The default value is 600px, for an adjustment see also chapter 1.7 in the Goobi viewer Core documentation.&#x20;

If the setting is active for a dataset, image delivery via the IIIF API is also restricted accordingly.

When updating to version 21.04, the access licences and rights configured in the backend must be checked and the new rights explicitly added!
{% endhint %}

### Structure element navigation

In the full screen view, it is possible to show two additional navigation elements to navigate between defined structural elements. The use case for the development is a digitised archive collection where it is necessary to navigate between the individual documents within a folder.&#x20;

See also chapter 1.11.2 in the Goobi viewer Core documentation.

### Archive view&#x20;

The image preview in the archive view has been extended. If digital copies of a unit of distortion were previously available, the representative was displayed and it was possible to switch to the image display. This functionality has been extended so that if structural elements are available from the first hierarchy level, the first image of the structural element is displayed as a thumbnail. Clicking on a thumbnail opens the picture in full screen view. In the case of a folder containing several individual documents, this provides a quick overview of the contents of the folder and enables the user to jump to a specific document.

### Tasks in the hotfolder&#x20;

The number of files / tasks in the hotfolder can be displayed in the blue top bar. For this purpose, the Goobi viewer Indexer and the Goobi viewer Core have been extended accordingly.&#x20;

Already today, the Goobi viewer Indexer passes information to the Goobi viewer Core after a successful indexing. For example, if images have been processed, it causes the image cache for the work to be emptied or it transmits its own version number for display on the dashboard of the admin backend. A new addition is that the Goobi view Indexer can now also determine the number of work orders in the hotfolder and then forward them. This is then displayed in the blue top bar in the backend. In this way, administrators can quickly see whether and how many files are still in the queue.&#x20;

Optionally, the top bar can also be displayed only for administrators in the frontend.
