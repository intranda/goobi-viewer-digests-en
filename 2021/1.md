# January

## Coming soon :rocket:&#x20;

* Adjustments to the **IIIF** interfaces
* Themes with **right-to-left reading direction**&#x20;
* **Emptying caches** from the user interface

## Announcements&#x20;

Goobi viewer has synchronised the versioning scheme with Goobi workflow. This means that you can now see which year and month a version is from. This version is now `21.01`. The two FAQ articles to find out how old a Goobi viewer is and how versioning works have been revised accordingly.&#x20;

With this release, the functionality to automatically replace structure types with others during indexing (see [chapter 2.4](https://docs.goobi.io/goobi-viewer-en/conf/2/4)) is officially discontinued. If institutions are still using it, they are hereby invited to contact us by email or in the community forum. We plan to remove this functionality from the Goobi view Indexer in a future release.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
There is a breaking change in the REST API! See also the corresponding section below.

### Record notes&#x20;

In the backend there is a new area for record notes. With the new functionality it is possible to add an individual new sidebar widget for a record with its own title and text. Depending on the styling in the theme, the functionality can also be moved to other places.&#x20;

In the record view, a new link is available for logged-in users with administrator rights in the widget "Changes of the record": "Add record note". After a click, the new area opens automatically in the backend. While some information about the record itself is displayed in the sidebar, title and text can be entered in the middle. The now familiar tab view with visual highlighting of the translations is available. In the back end, there is also a tabular overview of the notes created. A note can also be created there by entering an identifier.

### API

The work on refactoring the API is finally complete. In July last year, a large part of the API had already been refactored and moved to a new namespace. In the last few months, the last, mainly internal parts have finally been moved. This means that the area under `/rest/` has been completely removed and replaced by the new structure under `/api/v1/`.&#x20;

The new section `/api/v1/` offers many advantages. For the first time, the API is completely documented (see `/api/swagger/`). In addition, there is a test infrastructure in which a lot of code is already tested automatically and which will make it possible to increase the coverage there even further in the future. Also, the API is versioned from now on. This means that changes that are not backwards compatible can be made in another namespace (for example `/api/v2/`). Calls to `/api/v1/` are then not affected.&#x20;

Nevertheless, we have to bite a bullet: This is a so-called breaking change. If the old REST interface is still used, the calls must be adapted accordingly.&#x20;

### Maps&#x20;

It is now possible to use your own mapbox styles for the maps. There are new optional options for this in the configuration file. See also [chapter 1.36](https://docs.goobi.io/goobi-viewer-en/conf/1/36) in the documentation&#x20;

### Messages&#x20;

With the Maven changeover, the global messages files were no longer unpacked in the file system after an installation, but were packed inside the viewer-core.jar. We were now able to move the messages files to the goobi-viewer-core-config repository. This means that after installation they are again in the file system and are much easier to access.&#x20;

### Goobi viewer Indexer&#x20;

The Goobi viewer indexer has a new parameter to automatically generate a boolean field if the corresponding metadata is available. These can then be used in faceting for example. An example of use is, for example, that only certain records have location information and you only want to facet according to these records.&#x20;

See also [chapter 2.5](https://docs.goobi.io/goobi-viewer-en/conf/2/5#addexistenceboolean) in the documentation.

## Documentation&#x20;

The documentation of the Goobi viewer has been massively revised. It is now divided into different sections for a better overview. The sections for the Goobi viewer Indexer and the Goobi viewer Connector have been adapted to the Goobi viewer Core in terms of content, style and structure. Completely new is the description of the backend interface for the already revised pages. Just have a look, have fun browsing and looking things up. Please post your comments in the Community Forum :slight\_smile:&#x20;
