## Developments&#x20;

### Docker

![GEI enables deployment of the Goobi viewer in Docker containers](../.gitbook/assets/gei\_docker.png)

With the September release, the Docker setup is taking shape. A large number of works were published this month in this context. Existing containers were adapted and expanded, new ones were added and the first installation instructions for productive operation are now available.&#x20;

For easier management of the various containers and their interaction, the repository [goobi-viewer-docker](https://github.com/intranda/goobi-viewer-docker) was published, in which all the necessary files are available to realise a setup via Docker Compose.&#x20;

Two scenarios are available for the installation. A quick and trivial test scenario and one for productive use. A separate installation guide is also available for the latter.&#x20;

In the production scenario, we have made sure that as much as possible behaves in the same way as in a classic installation. This means that the folder structure is identical and the corresponding directories and configuration files are placed in the containers. Well-known aliases such as `ind` or `cata` are also available in the same way.

&#x20;In total, the Goobi viewer Docker setup consists of the following containers:&#x20;

* **goobi-viewer-docker**: Docker Compose files ([Github](https://github.com/intranda/goobi-viewer-docker))
* **goobi-viewer-docker-solr**: Apache Solr for the Goobi viewer ([Github](https://github.com/intranda/goobi-viewer-docker-solr))
* **goobi-viewer-docker-proxy**: HTTP proxy for the Goobi viewer ([Github](https://github.com/intranda/goobi-viewer-docker-proxy))
* **goobi-viewer-indexer**: Container with the Goobi viewer indexer ([Github](https://github.com/intranda/goobi-viewer-indexer))
* **goobi-viewer-connector**: Container with the Goobi viewer OAI & SRU interface ([Github](https://github.com/intranda/goobi-viewer-connector))
* **goobi-viewer-theme-reference**: Container with the Goobi viewer Reference Theme ([Github](https://github.com/intranda/goobi-viewer-theme-reference))

For the coming month, in addition to smaller developments, the main focus will be on tidying up, polishing, standardisation and documentation.

### Account

Until now, only administrators could delete an account within the Goobi viewer. Now users can do this themselves in the revised account settings. Furthermore, an individual profile picture can be uploaded for an account. Previously, users could only choose between a standard picture and the Gravatar service.

In the course of revising the area, a sidebar was also introduced in the backend on the user page.

### Metadata

A lot has happened in the context of metadata. Much may not be visible at first glance or may only become apparent when an update is made.&#x20;

The Goobi viewer now supports the display of metadata groups in groups. It does not matter from which file format (LIDO, METS/MODS) they originate.

![Visual representation of groups within groups](../.gitbook/assets/21.09-EN-metadata\_nested\_hierarchy.png)

In the course of this, the code itself was cleaned up. This part has only grown over the years. It is now better.&#x20;

Everyone can see that the document type or a structure type automatically appears before a block as a heading.

Some things have also changed in the context of LIDO. For example, during the clean-up work, it was noticed that there was a mix-up with the main metadata area for the configuration of the display of event metadata in the sidebar. From now on, even with LIDO metadata, the `<metadataView />` block only controls the display on the dedicated page, and the `<sideBarMetadataList />` defines the metadata for the sidebar.

Furthermore, we have adapted the terminology in the individual places so that LIDO data sets are referred to uniformly as "metadata" and no longer partly as "bibliographic data".

Last but not least, it is now also possible to configure metadata from events for display in the `<searchHitMetadataList />`.

### Maps

If coordinates are recorded for structural elements, they are displayed as markers or as a bounding box in the sidebar. It was already possible to select a structural element via the map.&#x20;

What is new is that the active marker or the active bounding box is now visually highlighted. For this purpose, the elements are coloured red. The active element is also automatically zoomed in so that it is clearly visible.

When faceting, the search hits in the map can be initially hidden via a switch if required. In addition, the address search in the map can now be deactivated via Mapbox.&#x20;

### Annotations&#x20;

The display of annotations in the work now has more possibilities. The widget in the sidebar has become slimmer and the usability has been improved. The optional display below the image now uses the same technical infrastructure as the sidebar widget and the display of the texts in the image can be globally deactivated so that only the frame is visible.&#x20;

### Goobi viewer Indexer&#x20;

In the Goobi viewer indexer there was a major internal change concerning the reading and management of the configuration file. This became necessary for indexing multi-level grouped metadata.&#x20;

Furthermore, the indexer can now automatically download images for METS/MODS files if the `_downloadImages` indicator folder exists in the file system.&#x20;

To make it easier to find LIDO events, the `ACCESSCONDITION` field is automatically written.&#x20;

### Miscellaneous&#x20;

* In the CMS template "Single view of a collection", the number of hits is now also displayed and sorting options are available.&#x20;
* If the feedback modal is called via the web fragment `#feedback`, the preselected entry can also be passed to the fragment if several addresses are configured, for example `#feedback:recipient=unicorn`.
