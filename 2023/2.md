description: Goobi viewer Digest for February 2023
---

# February

## Coming soon :rocket:&#x20;

* **Compact** and high-resolution **PDF files**

## Announcements

In February we worked a lot on projects and less on the Core itself. That's why this month's digest is shorter than usual.

## Developments

### Faceting&#x20;

In faceting, it is now possible to display more than one facet with a slider. For example, values such as "date of birth" and "date of death" can both be configured.&#x20;

In addition, it is possible to optionally display the slider as a graph. This visually highlights directly within the facet how many results are to be expected.

### REST

The REST endpoint for monitoring has been revised and now contains additional status information that simplifies diagnosis in the event of an error.
