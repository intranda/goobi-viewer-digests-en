## Developments

### Born Digital

When viewing Born Digital files, the component for accessing the files themselves has been moved to the top of the page. In addition, the component was changed to a tabular display of the information in order to be able to enter the information more quickly.

### Tickets&#x20;

Tickets have been added to the restricted access functionality. With a ticket, access Born-Digital content can only be unlocked after entering a ticket code.&#x20;

Tickets are basically a rights holder. This means that they must be linked to an IP range, for example. This IP range can be a reading room, for example, but of course a globally valid IP range can also be configured.&#x20;

If access to Born-Digital content is blocked by an access restriction and access is then enabled in a right, the ticket functionality can optionally be activated. This means that users can see that a file exists, but an additional ticket must be entered for the download. A modal opens for this. If there is no ticket yet, a new one can be requested there.

If a request has been made for a ticket, it will be reported on the Goobi viewer dashboard. Requests are managed on the "Rights" page. For each request, a corresponding box is displayed in the header. If there are active tickets, they are displayed in a table. Tickets are valid for 30 days and can be optionally extended.

![Dashboard with indication of new ticket request](../.gitbook/assets/22.07\_EN\_tickets-backend-dashboard.png) ![A ticket request can be Accepted or Rejected](../.gitbook/assets/22.07\_EN\_ticket-backend-rights.png) ![Active tickets are listed in a table](../.gitbook/assets/22.07\_EN\_ticket-backend-rights-two.png)

Expired tickets are automatically deleted without residue. If there are no tickets, the areas are not displayed.

### CMS&#x20;

The area for editing pages has received its first revisions. All global options have been moved from below the page to the sidebar. This is the first step towards revising the usability of this area in the coming months.

### Goobi viewer Indexer

The parameter `<addToParents />` has been given the optional attribute `keepOnChildren="true|false"` so that the highly inherited metadata does not only end up in the topmost element but remains in the whole hierarchy. This makes it possible, for example, to copy collection names from a structural element into the work.

Furthermore, the algorithm for determining folders that are in the hot folder during indexing and belong to a record has been improved.

### Development process&#x20;

For some time now, we have had the source code of the Goobi viewer components checked at irregular intervals using the static code analysis "Sonar". The results of the analysis are publicly available at the following address:&#x20;

* [https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/intranda/projects](https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/intranda/projects)

Over the past few months we have intensified the examination and correction of the points noted there, so that with this release we have now received an A rating for all components.

### Snippets

* The calendar search now supports passing the year in the URL.&#x20;
* The Goobi viewer can now optionally build a so-called Expand Query for search sub-hits from the current faceting, even if no concrete search terms have been entered. This can be used, for example, to find structural elements that belong to a special collection.
